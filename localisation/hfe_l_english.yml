 hfe.47.desc.0.0:0 "Greetings, New Life! We see your high potential and expect great deeds from you. To achieve the unity of thought between us, in form and goals, let us share with you our history and world views."
 hfe.47.desc.0.1:0 "Interesting! You have found our ancient subspace passage. You do not mind if we close it, right? Don't worry, we'll send you home when we're through."
 hfe.47.desc.1:0 "We have not always been like this. To become who we are today, we had to be forged through blood and despair. Millenia ago, our primitive ancestors were kidnapped by a sinister race called the §PAhets,§! to be used for building a colony. Stolen from our homelands and pressed into slavery, we had prepared to resign ourselves to hopelessness. Just when we had given up, we were suddenly freed, and the colony hadn't even been fullly established! Only a short time of our enslavement had passed when §PRa§! Himself, in His blazing chariot, led a rebellion and unleashed His Wrath on our foes! With His help, we destroyed the colonial ship-turned-capitol and slaughtered our former masters.\nThe remaining Ahet survivors were put to labor and our people utilized what was left of their technology to progress our civilization. So our journey began."
 hfe.47.desc.2:0 "We fought and won our freedom, taking pride in our victory, but pride became arrogance and we gradually forgot our gods. Consumed by the thirst for knowledge, we pushed our ambitions to every corner of the galaxy. It was the Golden Age of our people's civilization, for we unraveled many mysteries of the universe. We visited fascinating worlds and built wonderful cities where life had once been impossible.\nOne thousand years ago, we finally located our ancient homeworld in the §PSolar System.§! On the beautiful planet §PEarth§! we found the remnants of our kind in a primitive state, and we decided not to disturb them. We haven't visited Sol since then."

 hfe.47.desc.3.1:0 "Soon, the Gods put us to another trial. We faced a great foe, a detestable race we dubbed the Cylondaleks. Our great nation stood up to defend the Galaxy. In the end, we defeated and purged these creatures from everywhere under the light of §PRa.§!"
 hfe.47.desc.4:0 "Much knowledge had been lost, but more important was the memory reattained - of who we are. Only under the protection of true gods and eternal values could our dreams shape this universe. Thus reborn from ashes, we lit a new sun, built colonies anew and raised the pyramids. Under the guidance of the §PGreat Pharaoh,§! the prophet of §PRa,§! we welcome the New Life."
 hfe.47.desc.badend:0 "Despicable [Root.GetSpeciesNameInsult] fools! When the time comes, you will be punished for your disrespect."

 hfe.100.name:0 "After the War"
 hfe.100.desc:0 "Most of the planet's surface is covered with various smoke-belching factories. It would appear that some of them are being used as places of worship. Huge craters from explosions, resembling bruises and sores, are scattered across the landscape. Most likely they are remnants of a global war that raged here centuries ago.\nBecause of extreme pollution, there is little to no vegetation except for several pieces of land covered by protective domes. The oceans and rivers are filled with toxins and rusty scraps of metal. The atmosphere is unsuitable for unaided breathing due to the high level of contamination. Toxic smoke emits from thousands of factories that the world's population considers a manifestation of the divine, and so they continue to keep them running without producing anything. Despite the extreme airborne toxicity, they have adapted, and according to our agents, even mundane maintenance like the replacement of the breathing filters have become part of the society's elaborate religious rituals. Likewise, simpler safety procedures such as wearing face-masks to allow the population to breathe safely have gained religious signifigance."

 hfe.102.desc:0 "Our research teams have uncovered more about this society. Apparently, this world is governed by a theocracy: a §HCult of the Machine-That-Speaks-to-God,§! led a supreme, temporal spiritual ruler whose name, in the Varelse language, translates to §H''High Mechanicus''.§! One of the spies assigned to study the natives managed to seize a shipment of spare filters for us to study, which revealed a surprising secret. All of the population's air filters are spiked with drugs! Every filter contains a potent mixture that our scientists have dubbed Valerium, which causes severe hallucinations when inhaled. The population's regular ''revelations of the gods'' turned out to be nothing more than the result of a mind-altering substance! Unnoticed by the population, we have made contact with the High Mechanicus and have revealed his secret. He knows that releasing this information to the public may destroy the Cult.\n\nThe High Mechanicus is now our puppet. How are we going go exploit this?"

The §H[species.GetName]§! spy who found out about the filters lead the way, and he has unearthed an ancient tablet that turns out to be a portable database that belongs to a high-ranking clergyman of the planetary cult. Unfortunately, its hard drive has suffered irreparable damage after centuries of misuse. Still, our scientists have managed to recover bits of information, and one piece of the data is of particular interest."

 hfe.104.0.response:0 "Year 386 after The Fall. I am possibly the last of the Engineer corps. I record this so that those who come after will remember that we, the §PVarelse,§! were a proud and ambitious race. We reached for the stars and strived to know as much as we can. We've been curious, fearless and aspiring. Once on our journeys, we crossed paths with the §PJu Ahet§! civilization. A trail of misunderstandings, combined with a little of our pride and overconfidence, led to a great war which consumed hundreds of star systems. It turns out that we were the weaker ones. They shattered §PColony Alpha,§! our empire's capital and this planet's moon, to prove a point. They bombed §PColony Delta§! to plate glass. This planet was our last bastion, but eventually we had nothing to defend it with. In hopes of surviving the fiery Hell unleashed by their fleet, we descended into caves. Years later, they finally left our planet."
 hfe.104.1:0 "Replay fragment 2."
 hfe.104.1.response:0 "Our infrastructure mirrored the Fallen Empires, and we were stunned to see that its industrial core was still standing. The remains of our kind began to rebuild our cities, but we were changed by the stress of defeat and the looming fear that one day the §PJu Ahet§! may come back. We had no interest for the stars anymore. A §PCult of the Machine-That-Speaks-To-God§! spread throughout our ranks, claiming that the free, public distribution of knowlege was the reason of our defeat, and that, as penance, our production modules must be converted to machines that will cloud the atmosphere and convince the §HJu Ahet§! that we no longer remained alive. We listened to them willingly, trying to forget our loss. In time, there was no place among us where this accursed cult was not in charge. \nThe greatest of our production modules became their §PGodforge,§! simply called §P"The Factory".§! That became the vault of science in our midst. The Cult then began hunting down and executing any surviving engineers, and teaching a ''doctrine of Forgetness''. They believe that only the Cult's clergy can be trusted to understand the true nature of the technology they use. I am unable to change anything. Most of my comrades are gone or deceased. My only choice is to freeze myself in cryostasis, chasing the hope that, one day, I might serve and enlighten my people once again."

The clergy of the Machine-That-Speaks-to-God were slaughtered and the High Mechanicus was lynched at the citadel gates. We are told that his bodyguards fought valiantly to the end to save him. This allowed the opposition to take over, and anticlerical forces came to rule. It seems the Varelse are now ready to return to reason and sense. There is a long process of asking the right questions and seeking answers ahead. How to fix the biosphere? How do machines work if not with the help of the divine? Is there any life beyond our world? However, these troubles are no longer ours."

Suprisingly, it is still fully-functional. There is an information terminal in the center of the room.\nOne of our scientists managed to activate the terminal. The analysis showed that the pyramid is a huge isolated database. Apparently, those who built this pyramid believed that while embalming their mummies was a good first step to the afterlife, they deemed it insufficient. They decided to go one step further and save all information about them, including an exact replica mold of the deceased individual at the point of his death. Their minds were uploaded onto these servers. The last block of this peculiar burial ground contains a matrix and mind of the personality of a young, male alien, the same whose mummy we earlier encountered in one of the pyramid's chambers. That personality was transfered to our terminal."

The pictures gradually become more gloomy. Information network... rumors of war... oppressive expectations... attempts to convince oneself that everything will go well and the §PGreat Pharaoh§! knows what he is doing... . The flashing imagery takes an even greater turn for the worse.

The still-working terminal flickers in the center of the room. In the process of studying the terminal, scientists accidentally activate the complex and release the forces locked in it.\nAs a result of the careless actions of our research group, the planet was captured by something aggressive and taciturn.

We decided to replenish stocks, but unexpectedly discovered a sapient species broken into countless primitive civilizations. One civilization on this planet in particular piqued our interest: they created massive stone monuments, mastered the embalming process, and worshipped a pantheon of gods ranging from their star to the rivers that flowed through their deserts.\nOur numbers were low, and this turned out to be a great opportunity to get a working force for our race, and later, a great opportiunuty for me..."

When speaking with the representatives of that race, §Phumans,§! as they were called, I could only express compassion and sympathy regarding their future. On my urgent recommendation, we forcibly seized several dozen settlements and many thousands of this race, to use them during the initial stages of the forthcoming colonization. Perhaps my expedition's branch of the §PLay Council§! was surprised when I volunteered to organize the placement and control of these savages aboard my expedition's ships.\nThe unfortunate and rapid decline of healthy §PAhets§! on our planet meant that, fortunately for the primitives, my ships had plenty of empty seating. Personally, I blame the §PLay Council.§! Without the englightening beacon of the §PGreat Minds§! to organize the expedition, the §PLay Council's§! incompetence and poor planning lead our civilization to further collapse, as they acted before consulting me and my brilliant mind. Imagine how many more expeditions could have been sent off if the §PLay Council§! had let me plan the whole thing! Can a conscious citizen be blamed for scorning the repetition of history? It's time to triumph through intelligence."

Needless to say, no one wanted to stay in there, which led to them unwittingly spreading it even further until the military finally got involved. I tried to speak with our §PLay Council,§! staffed mainly by the military, but I was ignored. It seems like these men are blind as *unintelligble*. Or maybe they do not see an ally in me?

 hfe.530.desc:0 "You see a research ship sinking in the glittering veil of the gate, you see an intolerable light, hear voices, where your ship turned out to be is not space-time. It is some original substance passionately dreaming to embody, it stretches towards you, clears the mind of the ship’s shell and the flesh of its [root.hfe_scripted_loc_crew]. You suddenly realize that now you can make everything out of this mass. Sculpt yourself, decorate your world. You see the planets, the sun, and galaxies created, the tapestry of time intertwines from the plastic matter of life, shining threads flow between the fingers, the past, the present, the future... an infinite world of possibilities. Now, the last flashes of energy are extinguished, and it is dark once again.\n\nEscaping from dissolving, the essence rushes to where it came from, but the passage is too narrow... and it has changed too much, and no longer belongs to this world. The essence perishes and the ship on the other side dissolves. Yet, in an incomprehensible way, she is at the beginning as much as at the end... realizing that, she calms down and turns the hourglass of time.\n\nFurther images appear in your brain: it's the voice of §H[hfe_stargate_scientist.GetName]!§! The consciousness that once was §H[hfe_stargate_scientist.GetName]§! and the [root.hfe_scripted_loc_crew] of §H[from.GetName]§! has become something equal to a god, and is in itself a cyclic system of creation.\nIt is everywhere and is not able to separate itself from the universe, forever surviving its birth, life, death, and rebirth. \nYou turn off the neural interface. The understanding comes that the darkness of the portal is not a threat. The [root.hfe_scripted_loc_crew] are happy, fulfilled, and together. You can practically feel the beaming grins and dazzling hope in their visual receptors as they tearfully embrace their incorporal forms as one. This new divinity is in some way your scientists, still looking for answers. They have been given the ultimate gift.\nAfter a short time, the darkness around the portal dissolves, now it’s just a smoking lump of dead metal that lifted the veil of endless wonders waiting ahead. A quiet whisper echoes in your mind.\n\n"Thank... you..."\n\n Then, all is silent."

It seems that all hits are random, and whatever our scientists fought, it failed to cause the ship serious harm.\nFrom the report we learn that the portal leads to a parallel universe, very similar to ours, but with a different passage of time, and instrument readings younger than ours by thousands of years. Right now there is a galaxy-wide war raging. Scientists had to use all the technologies available to them in order to remain imperceptible, to gather as much information as possible and to have time to return before the war on the other side destroyed the portal."

In a vase in the corner, the Desert Lily is blooming - an amazing plant, as if cut from obsidian, found by myself on §H[hfe_555_dry_planet.GetName]§! and able to exist completely without water. On the wall nearby is the rare phaser of my grandfather, which faithfully served him for many years. I stand on the fibers of thick §H[hfe_555_friendly_relation.GetName]§! carpet, donated from an ambassador. It is decorated with intricate, changing colors at different times of the day pattern. But the most valuable thing lurked in the corner of the room: my faithful friend, §GJean Luc.§! We met at §H[hfe_555_ocean_planet.GetName]§! during one of my business trips before I assumed my current position as §H[root.GetRulerTitle].§! He is a sensible cephalopod and the last of his kind. §GJean Luc§! is a great warriors, whose species' glory raged throughout the galaxy thousands of years ago. There is no other creature in the whole galaxy to whom I could trust more.\nBut this night, disturbing thoughts do not leave me. Something was wrong."
 hfe.556.desc.1:0 "There was a noise outside the door, a sound like a shot, then a romp and silence. I called the guard, after a moment the door to the room opened. Something resembling a person was on the threshold, but judging by the part of the face burned by the blaster, it was not at all.\nWith the remnants of the synthetic skin of the face I had difficulty, but recognized the head of the research mission on the planet §H[hfe_memorial_planet.GetName]§! disappeared quite recently, but it seems that even then a person was replaced by something more deadly, apparently created by the previous owners of the planet, the §PJu Ahets.§!\nThe ancient robot looks at me through the dying remains of synthetic skin. One of the hands is missing, and the other in my eyes turns into a blade. There is no doubt about his intentions: he is here to kill me.\nI'm unarmed, standing near the window.

A fascinating parasite. A §PWorm,§! which would enter the very mind of its host and control it entirely. It was impossible to detect. The victim would remain conscious, not feeling any discomfort.

Those who respect the Cult's sovereignty will find that they are actually quite interested in both trade and cooperation, so long as that does not involve sharing knowledge.

Instead, civilizations under Worm Authority are actually under the imposing presence of a Brain Worm.\nA Brain Worm is any species of tiny, parasitic lifeform that considers itself to be the pinnacle of all evolution. Deeming itself the only species worthy of ruling the galaxy, but unable to do so in its natural body, Brain Worms instead locate and infects a host- the vessel -and from there, what happens depends on the type and "personality" of the Brain Worm host. \nBrain Worms can range from a benevolent but seriously paternalistic conscience in their vessel's head to a vicious entity that only consider vessels to be their body. Many types of Brain Worms tolerate or even embrace their vessel's Free Will, and some allow those without an infection to live on special reservations where they are without need. Others do the opposite, and still others only consider rulers worthy of being vessels while the rest toil. \nNo one Brain Worm species is alike, and all treat their Vessels differently.  \n\n§RNote:§!

Therefore, while they may freely use them, the general public cannot be allowed to understand the real workings of any machine, spaceship, or concept more advanced than an Atomic Age society. All understanding of technology is strictly regulated by the Cult of the Machine-That-Speaks-to-God and stored deep in the sprawling capitol of the religious movement, under the watchful, absolute authority of the High Mechanicus. \n  Adapting to the discovery of faster-than-light travel, though the society does have modern technology and interstellar flight, the Cult forbids anyone from taking apart the machinery or learning the true nature of the products they use every day. Instead, they are taught that machines are divinely powered and that opening the inner workings causes one's soul to fall apart, corrupting anyone they touch. Even intentionally taking apart a Spacebook terminal or intentionally dismantling a sub-stellar radio is punishable by death."

They fought past the legendary Adaptus Legion that protects the High Mechanicus and lynched him, displaying his head at the citadel's gate. \n Replacing him is the Fabricator-General and the Euphorically Enlightened Anticlerical Movement, which believes the sole purpose of society is to advance technology and one's self, with the ultimate goal of becoming like PERFECT, IMMORTAL MACHINES."

 hfe_deposit_mechanicus_farm_spire_desc:0 "$building_nourishment_center_desc$ This tower is the tallest structure on Colony Beta and once represented the pinnacle of all Varelsite technology. In contrast to the Nourishment Center of other Awakened Empires, the Varelse focused on condensing their food needs to one location. All agriculture, an entire empire's food output, was stuffed into this miraculous structure. Now, centuries later, it is the last lifeline for its inhabitants. The Godforge keeps it running. If Colony Beta should be invaded or damaged, its automated functions will likely fail, neccesitating the reentry of hundreds of thousands of farmer Jobs. \n\n\n§RNOTE: If the player controls this structure, it will generate ten £job_farmer£ Farmer Jobs and other food-related bonuses while consuming either £energy£ Energy or £volatile_motes£ Volatile Motes, depending on whether or not the player has the technology to use the latter. For the AI, the Spire will instead ensure Colony Beta is self-sufficient in agriculture.§!"
